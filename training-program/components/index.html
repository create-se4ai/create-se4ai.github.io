systems.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="course-topics"></a>Course Topics<a class="hash-link" href="#course-topics" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As part of the course, relevant topics related to:</p><ul><li>requirement engineering</li><li>managing code across technology stacks and libraries</li><li>test and debug</li><li>implementing continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD), performance analysis</li><li>managing evolution will be covered.</li></ul><p>The main
focus of the course is on the interconnection of SE+AI and how these topics apply for AI-based systems.
For example, issues related to CI/CD during development while handling large training data and managing
model evolution and tracking accuracy as the AI-based software systems evolve are unique aspects that
will be covered in this course. As part of the course, trainees will conduct a hands-on project with our
industrial partners where they will exercise the theory learned in the course. Trainees will have the option
to either study an existing AI-based system or develop a new system as part of the project. Trainees will
prepare case reports (similar to Harvard Business School Case Reports) about their projects. The prepared
cases will be used in following years to enrich our training and will be disseminated to the international
community.</p><p>Although the course will mainly focus on the engineering of AI-based systems, trainees will be asked
to reflect on the social aspects and how they influenced the engineering aspects of the system. This will
prepare the trainees for C2. Since all of the CREATE trainees are required to take this course, it will
be delivered online (something that all co-PIs are familiar with now) to trainees from all institutions to
participate. This course prepares our trainees for C4, C5, C6, and C7.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="new-course-on-social-aspects-for-ai-based-software-system"></a>New course on Social Aspects for AI-based Software System<a class="hash-link" href="#new-course-on-social-aspects-for-ai-based-software-system" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>A newly developed course that focuses
on various social criteria that AI-based systems need to consider, e.g., privacy, ethics, equity, diversity,
inclusion (EDI), human rights and sustainable development goals (SDG). Trainees will be introduced to
the fundamental theories, normative frameworks and ethical concepts and will learn to apply them on AI-based
systems. To gain applied knowledge on the concepts they are taught, trainees will be provided with
existing AI-based systems, or can use their projects from C1, and will be asked to write a report on these
systems. The reports will examine the various social aspects of the system being studied and report on how
these aspects have been considered (or not) in the studied systems. Trainees will be asked to come up with
an ethical assessment and concrete recommendations for such systems, while considering the engineering
implications of their recommendations.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="training-objectives"></a>Training Objectives<a class="hash-link" href="#training-objectives" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Training objectives of this new course are:</p><ul><li>understanding the social impact of AI: students will learn
what social impact is and will study cases that illustrate the (positive or negative) social impact of AI.</li><li>understanding and applying the human rights approach: this will be achieved by discussing selected case
studies for which students will be trained to identify potential human rights violations.</li><li>identifying and
setting ethical parameters: as part of the courseâ€™s project, students will develop an ethics dashboard for AI
development; ethical parameters include the consideration of environment, animal welfare, economy and
ecosystems.</li><li>professionally engaging with communities: in the second part of the course, there will
be a round table discussion with participants who are impacted differently by and involved in the AI life
circle, such as AI developers, representatives from vulnerable groups (Black students and communities,
Indigenous communities). Students will learn to professionally engage in these discussions, to apply their
ethical as well as technical knowledge, and to listen and understand concerns from other perspectives.</li><li>developing an identity as a socially responsible professional/researcher: Students will understand the
role, responsibility, accountability and scope of influence of engineers and researchers in context of AI and
social equity.</li></ul><p>They will be trained to critically reflect their role and their profession with regards to ethics
and values.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="professional-development-for-ai-based-software-system-practitioners"></a>Professional Development for AI-based Software System Practitioners<a class="hash-link" href="#professional-development-for-ai-based-software-system-practitioners" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The co-PIs will develop
modules that focus on professional skills in the context of AI-Software Systems. This includes specialized
modules on professional skills (e.g., dissemination and presentation skills, commercialization and entrepreneurship,
communication and explainability) and aspects of engagement and relation-building with
communities and diverse stakeholders (more in Section 2.3). In addition to newly developed modules, we
will also include a curated list of relevant professional development modules that fit our CREATE program
offered through the organizations such as Mitacs, and local universities (e.g. Concordiaâ€™s GradProSkills,
Queenâ€™s Smith School of Business, Centre for Teaching and Learning, University Research Services, and
School of Graduate Studies). Trainees will also be given the ability to choose the modules that better fit
their expected future career aspirations (e.g., academic researcher versus entrepreneur). See Section 2.3
for more details. We will require that graduate trainees will take at least 2 modules as part of their program.
The professional development modules prepare our trainees for C4, C5 and C7.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="industrial-embedding"></a>Industrial Embedding<a class="hash-link" href="#industrial-embedding" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Graduate trainees will be offered the opportunity to serve one or more internships
with our industrial partners. Masterâ€™s trainees will typically serve a single four-month internship,
typically after their second term in the program (i.e., after they have completed the bulk of their courses).
PhD trainees will typically serve two four-month internships. We believe that this graduate level internship
program will be significantly more attractive to industry than typical internship programs, since 1) our
graduate trainees will be well-prepared for their internships through our training (e.g., C1, C2, and C3), 2)
our trainees will be supported by their academic supervisors (i.e., the CREATE co-PIs), and 3) our trainees
will bring a diverse pool since EDI is at the core of our recruitment strategy (highlight in Section 4.3).</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="industry-webinars-or-on-site-seminars"></a>Industry webinar(s) or on-site seminar(s)<a class="hash-link" href="#industry-webinars-or-on-site-seminars" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>All trainees are required to present at least one online
webinar and/or an on-site seminar to one or more industrial partners.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="seminar-roles"></a>Seminar Roles<a class="hash-link" href="#seminar-roles" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>These seminars will serve four roles:</p><ol><li>provide trainees with hands-on real-life presentation experience to an academic and non-academic audience.</li><li>provide trainees with an opportunity to expand their professional network for post-graduation hiring opportunities.</li><li>communicate some of the academic innovations to practitioners and academics,</li><li>serve as recruitment medium for trainees into our CREATE. C1, C2, C3 and C4 and each traineeâ€™s supervisor/mentors will prepare the trainees well for this industrial interaction.</li></ol><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="specialization-courses"></a>Specialization courses<a class="hash-link" href="#specialization-courses" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Trainees of the CREATE program will be required to take at least one
specialization course from a curated list of courses on SE, AI, and Social concepts. The exact number of
specialization courses depends on the traineeâ€™s home institution and program. For example, at Concordia
University, PhD trainees are required to take 3 courses, hence they will take C1, C2 and choose one
specialization course. Masterâ€™s students are required to take 4 courses, hence, they will take C1, C2 and
choose two specialization courses.</p><p>Where applicable (e.g., when the co-PIs are teaching these courses), modules covering SE and/or
AI and/or social aspects interactions will be added to each of these courses. Specialization courses include
courses in: Software Analytics, Software Quality, Software Testing, Product Lines, Software Re-engineering,
Software Architecture, Advanced Concepts in Cloud Computing, Neural Network, Reinforcement
Learning, Deep Learning, Advanced AI, Ethics, Development and Global Engineering, EDI in
STEM. The aforementioned list is a preliminary list that will change and evolve. Protocols are already in
place to allow trainees to obtain credit for courses taken at non-home institutions to maximize the number
of specialization courses available to our trainees. The exact specialization course(s) a trainee will take will
be determined in consultation with their supervisor(s)/mentor(s) and communicated through their training
plan (presented in below).</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor" id="hands-on-leadership-and-mentorship-training"></a>Hands-on leadership and mentorship training<a class="hash-link" href="#hands-on-leadership-and-mentorship-training" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>To position trainees to be successful and socially
responsible leaders in their field, we plan to incorporate hands-on leadership and mentorship training. This
training will be achieved through a multitude of mechanisms. We will provide opportunities for trainees to
serve as mentors-in-training (MIT) along supervisors to more junior trainees. For example, PhD students
and postdocs can serve as MITs to undergrad and MSc, and PhD trainees, respectively. MITs will be
trained to incorporate EDI principles in leadership, including equity aspects in collaboration, evaluation
and assessment (e.g. counteracting gender, racial, cultural and language bias), as well as equitable modes
of collaboration (e.g. monitoring speaking time in group meeting to give everybody the opportunity to
participate and contribute). To ensure a comprehensive training of the MITs, they will be given the option
to mentor trainees in all aspects, i.e., proposing research projects, supporting progress, as well as advising
them on technical writing, presentation, and research methodology issues</p><p>In addition, the CREATE team will promote trainees to be exposed and serve in leadership roles. This
way, trainees will gain first-hand experience in leadership. All co-PIs are well-established and world renowned
leaders and are fully committed to leveraging their network (e.g., connections with leaders in
industry, steering committees, organization committees to international events) to promote trainees.
Distinguished researchers and industry leaders will be invited to take part in our annual retreat. This will serve
as an opportunity for our trainees to shine, interact and learn from these distinguished leaders.</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/training-program/objectives"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Â« Objectives</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#new-course-on-engineering-ai-based-software-systems" class="table-of-contents__link">New course on Engineering AI-based Software Systems</a><ul><li><a href="#course-topics" class="table-of-contents__link">Course Topics</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#new-course-on-social-aspects-for-ai-based-software-system" class="table-of-contents__link">New course on Social Aspects for AI-based Software System</a><ul><li><a href="#training-objectives" class="table-of-contents__link">Training Objectives</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#professional-development-for-ai-based-software-system-practitioners" class="table-of-contents__link">Professional Development for AI-based Software System Practitioners</a></li><li><a href="#industrial-embedding" class="table-of-contents__link">Industrial Embedding</a></li><li><a href="#industry-webinars-or-on-site-seminars" class="table-of-contents__link">Industry webinar(s) or on-site seminar(s)</a><ul><li><a href="#seminar-roles" class="table-of-contents__link">Seminar Roles</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#specialization-courses" class="table-of-contents__link">Specialization courses</a></li><li><a href="#hands-on-leadership-and-mentorship-training" class="table-of-contents__link">Hands-on leadership and mentorship training</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Info</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/about">About Us</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/training-program/objectives">Objectives</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/training-program/components">Components</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/create-se4ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/create-se4ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Partner Universities</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.concordia.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Concordia University</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.polymtl.ca/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Polytechnique MontrÃ©al</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.queensu.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Queen&#x27;s University</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.ualberta.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">University of Alberta</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="margin-bottom--sm"><img src="/img/NSERC_WHITE.png" alt="NSERC" class="themedImage_1VuW themedImage--light_3UqQ footer__logo"><img src="/img/NSERC_WHITE.png" alt="NSERC" class="themedImage_1VuW themedImage--dark_hz6m footer__logo"></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>We acknowledge the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).</p>Copyright Â© 2021 DAS Lab.</div></div></div></footer></div>
