His research interests are in the intersection of Software Engineering, Programming Languages, and Artificial Intelligence. He has worked on Machine Learning (ML) software repository mining and analysis in large-scale using the Boa framework. He worked on building Python language support for Boa to analyze ML programs and Jupyter Notebooks. Currently, he is working in the D4 (Dependable Data-Driven Discovery) initiative at ISU towards increasing the dependability of data-driven software. Specifically, he is conducting research on understanding the societal bias in ML models and reasoning about fairness property and its mitigation in ML pipelines. His research results appeared in reputed software engineering venues including ICSE and ESEC/FSE.  \\n\\n**Homepage**: https://sumonbis.github.io"},{"id":"upcoming","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/upcoming","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-21-upcoming/index.md","title":"Upcoming Events","description":"Trainee Talks Webinar - December 13, 2022 from 11AM - 12PM","date":"2022-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 21, 2022","tags":[],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"prevItem":{"title":"Past Events","permalink":"/blog/past"}},"content":"## Trainee Talks Webinar - December 13, 2022 from 11AM - 12PM\\n\\nimport trainee_talk_2 from \'./trainee_talk_2.jpg\'\\n\\n<p class=\\"trainee_talk_2\\"><img src={trainee_talk_2} width=\\"800\\"/></p>\\n\\nTrainee Talks is a monthly webinar series featuring [CREATE SE4AI](https://se4ai.org/) trainees sharing their research topics in software engineering and AI.\xa0\xa0\xa0\\n\\nCome ready to learn something new!\xa0\\n\\nJoin us on\u202f**Tuesday, December 13th\u202fat 11:00 AM EST** as we welcome\u202fQueen\u2019s University Master\u2019s student Ernesto Lang Oreamuno.
