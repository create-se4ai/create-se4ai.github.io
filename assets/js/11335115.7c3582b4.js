To ensure relevance and customer satisfaction, software systems need to continuously change. One way to facilitate this continuous change of software systems is to re-engineer them. Software re-engineering is defined as "the examination and alteration of a subject system to reconstitute it in a new form and the subsequent implementation of a new form". Generally speaking, software re-engineering has two phases: a reverse engineering phase where a representation of the system is created through the identification of software components and their relations. The second phase is a forward engineering phase, where a system is reconstructed in a new and improved form.
