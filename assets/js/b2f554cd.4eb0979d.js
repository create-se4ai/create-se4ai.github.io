The goals of the workshop were to:\\n1. Introduce the basic concepts of AI and chatbots to the students\\n2. Encourage the students to develop confidence interacting with technology\\n3. Stimulate a discussion of ethics of AI in society through a group reflection exercise\\n\\nAt the end of the workshop, the students shared their experiences interacting with chatbots and reflected on the importance of creating responsible and ethical AI.\\n\\nCREATE was proud to contribute to this important initiative, and we look forward to more opportunities to engage with youth and inspire them to learn more about software engineering and AI in the future. \\n\\nimport wie1 from \'../wie1.jpg\'\\nimport wie2 from\'../wie2.jpg\'\\nimport wie3 from \'../wie3.jpg\'\\nimport wielogo from \'../wielogo.jpg\'\\n\\n<img class=\\"image\\" src={wie1} alt=\\"wie1\\" width=\\"245\\"/>\\n<img class=\\"image\\" src={wie2} alt=\\"wie2\\" width=\\"245\\"/>\\n<img class=\\"image\\" src={wie3} alt=\\"wie3\\" width=\\"245\\"/>"}]}')}}]);
