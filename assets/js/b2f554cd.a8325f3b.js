His research interests are in the intersection of Software Engineering, Programming Languages, and Artificial Intelligence. He has worked on Machine Learning (ML) software repository mining and analysis in large-scale using the Boa framework. He worked on building Python language support for Boa to analyze ML programs and Jupyter Notebooks. Currently, he is working in the D4 (Dependable Data-Driven Discovery) initiative at ISU towards increasing the dependability of data-driven software. Specifically, he is conducting research on understanding the societal bias in ML models and reasoning about fairness property and its mitigation in ML pipelines. His research results appeared in reputed software engineering venues including ICSE and ESEC/FSE.  \\n\\n**Homepage**: https://sumonbis.github.io"},{"id":"upcoming","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/upcoming","source":"@site/blog/2022-09-21-upcoming/index.md","title":"Upcoming Events","description":"","date":"2022-09-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"September 21, 2022","tags":[{"label":"upcoming events","permalink":"/blog/tags/upcoming-events"},{"label":"news","permalink":"/blog/tags/news"},{"label":"webinars","permalink":"/blog/tags/webinars"},{"label":"trainee talks","permalink":"/blog/tags/trainee-talks"}],"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Lori Akiyama","title":"Program Coordinator"}],"prevItem":{"title":"Past Events","permalink":"/blog/past"}},"content":""}]}')}}]);
