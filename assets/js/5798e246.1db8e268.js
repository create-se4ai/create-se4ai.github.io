At SIE, we will delve into their scalable, real-time, low-latency predictive ML-based solutions that are implemented on the cloud in order to personalize purchasing and playing experiences. Medable, on the other hand, has implemented an automated, decentralized clinical trials platform on the cloud in order to greatly improve efficiency and accuracy. Throughout this session, we will also discuss the role of machine learning engineering and the exciting opportunities that lie ahead in this field.
